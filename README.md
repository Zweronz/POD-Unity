# POD-Unity
a tool for importing POD models into unity

very unfinished! not very well tested!
bones are completely non functional at this time

right now it loads pods directly from streamingassets on an object with PodUnityTest attached to it
it loads textures directly from resources in formats that unity can process (see my powervr to png repo)

there's bound to be errors or nullchecks I haven't yet fixed, however support will be ongoing for now
